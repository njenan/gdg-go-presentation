comment on interesting features of the language

'clean' syntax, no parens around if-else or loops
while loop is just a for loop with no args


functions
- defer functions
  - stacking
  - this is go's 'finally' block
- Closures


Pointers
- They exist, but no pointer arithmetic


Dependency management
- Still in its infancy- isn't as full fledged as something like maven or npm
- 'Vendoring' is a possible solution (copying source into repository)
- Do demo of Vendoring this is what google does [source](http://jbeckwith.com/2015/05/29/dependency-management-go/)


General notes
- No type coercion, must be explicit
